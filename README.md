# Auditorium-Management

# problem Statement

Students’ Auditorium Management Software. Various types of social and cultural events are conducted in the students’ auditorium. There are two categories of seats: balcony seats and ordinary seats.
Normally balcony seats are more expensive in any show. The show manager fixes the price of these two
categories of seats depending on the popularity of a show. The show manager also determines the number
of balcony and ordinary seats that can be put on sale, since for each show some seats are offered as complimentary gifts to different functionaries of the students’ society and to VIPs. The show manager also enters
the show dates, the number of shows on any particular date and the show timings.


The spectators book their seats in advance by paying the full ticket price to the authorizes sales persons.
The spectators indicate the type of the seat and the computer should print out the ticket clearly showing
the seat numbers. The spectators’ can cancel their booking before 3 clear days of the show. In this case
the ticket price is refunded to them after deducting Rs.5/- as the booking charge per ticket. If a ticket is
returned within 3 days and 1 day of a show, a booking charge of Rs.10/- is deducted for ordinary tickets
and Rs.15/- is deducted for balcony tickets. On the last day of the show, there is a 50% deduction. The
system should let the spectators query the availability of different classes of seats.


The show manager can query any time about the percentage of seats booked for various classes of seats and
the amount collected in each case. The show manager creates login accounts for authorized sales persons.
When any authorizes sales person logs in and makes a sale, the computer should record the sales person’s
id in the sales transaction. This information would help in computing the commission payable to each sales
person and also the amount collected by each sales person. These data can be queried by the show manager.



The accounts clerk should be able to enter the various types of expenditures incurred for a show including
payment to artists. The computer should prepare a balance sheet for every show and a comprehensive
up-to-date balance sheet for every year. The different types of balance sheets should be accessible to the
manager only.
